    Pan drippings from Easy Thanksgiving Turkey
    1/4 cup unsalted butter
    1/4 cup all-purpose flour
    2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme
    1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley leaves
    Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

    Directions:

    Strain pan drippings through a fine-mesh sieve; discard solids and reserve 2 1/2 cups pan drippings; set aside.
    Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in flour and thyme until lightly browned, about 1 minute.
    Gradually whisk in reserved pan drippings. Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, whisking constantly, until thickened, about 5-10 minutes. Stir in parsley; season with salt and pepper, to taste.
    Serve warm.
