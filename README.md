# About Me
Recently due to COVID-19, my tenure in the Travel Industry has been impacted dramatically.   I have been at [CWT (primary subsidiary of Carlson in Minnetonka, MN)](https://www.mycwt.com) since my first gig out of college, just short of 24 years. 

I find motivation and passion behind building high performing engineering teams, being involved in an engineering cultured company and open by default approach to communications.  I have experience in influencing cultures on teams I have worked on that have tenants of trust, default to open, customer focused, winning spirit, product mindset, and cost consciousness. 

I truly love teams and organization culture, thus my entire career has been with the same company developing and leading teams in building Technology Solutions for the Travel Industry, these teams range from Software Development to Operation teams.   

I am an experienced Product and Technology leader with a demonstrated history of being outcome driven.  I am a proven performance-driven leader, who has led and implemented transformative technology strategies across a Global Technology organization and I am extremely passionate about culture!
